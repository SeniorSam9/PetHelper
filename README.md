# swe463_project


## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

## How to run the app ? 
first go to the firebase directory and run server.js (node server.js on command)
after that you run the main.dart file..
now you can use the app as a user.. create your account -- > log in -- > and start helping some pets..
* if you couldn't post a pet try to upload smaller image size (preferably less than 100kb )
